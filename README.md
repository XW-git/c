c repo main branch contains individual c files, which demostrates certain function.
example print-color.c
gcc print-color.c -o print-color
./print-color
demo you printed colored text

in c repo there are other branches. they are all c related projects. each branch are independent. and have nothing to do with main branch.
this is not usual way of using branch. my innovation.

if you want to clone uart-term-cmd branch
git clone git@github.com:XW-git/c.git -b uart-term-cmd c/uart-term-cmd
all the source code will be copied to c/uart-term-cmd
